## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

1.  **Create a new repository on GitHub.**
2.  **Initialize a Git repository in your project folder:**
    ```bash
    git init
    git branch -m main
    ```
3.  **Add all the files to the staging area:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
4.  **Commit the files:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
5.  **Add the remote repository (replace `<your-repository-url>` with your actual repo URL):**
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
    ```
6.  **Push the files to the `main` branch:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```
7.  **In your repository settings on GitHub, go to the "Pages" section.**
8.  **Select the `main` branch as the source and `/ (root)` as the folder, then click "Save".**

Your website will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/` shortly.
